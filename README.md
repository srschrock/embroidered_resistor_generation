# EMBROIDERED ELECTRONIC RESISTOR GENERATION

## Background / info
This is part of a research project to develop flexible wearable electronics. 

This python tool generates .exp files which are used by Melco, Bravo, and Bernina machines.

Give the program input parameters such as target resistance and unit resistance of the conductive thread. The program will create a resistor to your specifications, save the .exp file, and show the generated resistor in a plot. 

All parameters are adjustable, such as gap length between lines, stitch length, terminal pad length, etc.
